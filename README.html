<h3 id="1.0">1.0 Project Description.</h3>

<p>The BasicVersion project repository manages Basic system builds
across multiple computers. Each computer is given a unique machine ID that
corresponds to a configuration specific to that machine. A given computer may 
have several machine IDs, but only one at a time may be the "running" computer
designation.</p>

<p>No specific system is considered to be the "golden" system for Basic. To
support updating and maintenance from any of the development systems the
Basic system may be updated from any development system. BasicVersion
supports version control of the various pieces of Basic across all the
development systems.</p>

<p>Version control is accomplished by having each computer initialize its setup so
that whenever a Terminal session is started, the Terminal session has system
environment variables set identifying the machine and any operating system
characteristics, as well as the Basic system version. These environment
variables are then available for any shells or other programs that execute under
the parent Terminal session.

<h3 id="2.0">2.0 Dependencies.</h3>

<p>The BasicVersion project depends upon the system-wide configuration file system
for storing system configuration information. On GNU-based systems this file
system is typically resident in a ~/.config folder. On Windows-based systems this
file system is related to the Windows registry of installed apps. Since all
current machines are running GNU-based systems, only those systems are addressed
in this version of the documentation.</p>

<p>The BasicVersion project depends upon the folder ~/.config/Basic for
storing the Basic configuration information. The config.sh file in that
folder contains all of the accounting configuration environment variables. The
APPCONFIG_PATH system environment variable within this config.sh file is
always set to point to the ~/.config/Basic folder.</p>

<p>If the computer is running a non-persistent OS, it is left to the user to ensure
that the system startup initializes the ~/.config/Basic/config.sh file and
sets up .bashrc so that any Terminal session has the path to the Basic
configuration environment variables set at startup.</p>

<p>Whenever a user commences working on accounting, on entering the Terminal
session he needs to run the subsystem control shell. System-wide aliases have
been defined to facilitate this. The "chsubsys" alias changes the active
subsystem within which the user is commencing work. While several subsystems are
supported on any given development system, the subsystem which is relevant
for Basic sessions is "Basic".</p>

<p>Within each branch of the BasicVersion repository, the following files are
needed:</p>

<pre><code>
config.sh.< machine-id >.basic - generic Basic configuration file updated
  with each cyle change.

config.sh.< machine-id >.basic.$Basic_BLD - Basic configuration file
  created by administrator from config.sh.< machine-id >.Basic file with latest
  configuration information.

CurrVersion - current Basic version on this branch; updated by SetVersion
  shell from the *master branch.
</code></pre>

<p>The system SYSEDIT shell updates the running Basic configuration with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SYSEDITv3.&lt; machine-id >  config  basic<br>
See the documentation within the SYSEDITv3 shell for details on this process.

<h3 id="3.0">3.0 Version Naming.</h3>

<p>Basic uses one version name, Basic_BLD. The version is comprised of i.j.k
where 'i' is the version number, 'j' is the revision number, and 'k' is the
cycle number. Whenever ANY Basic data or code is modified, the Basic_BUILD
cycle is advanced. Whenever ANY</p>

<p>There is no requirement that the various _BUILD cycles be synchronized, since
this would be an overwhelming management issue. The _BUILD cycles do, however,
provide a tracking mechanism for releases of publisher territories. Whenever a
new release of Basic is built, it contains the file:</p>

<pre><code>
    Basic_BLD.a.b.c - the Basic build cycle
</code></pre>

<p>This provides the tracking information to determine where an issue may have
been introduced into the Basic system.</p>

<p>BasicVersion has a *git branch for each development system. The BasicVersion
project within each branch has the version name of the current build version
present on that system's branch. The central GitHub repository for BasicVersion
is constantly updated by each development system as changes are made for its
branch. In turn, the *master branch is always updated by a development system
whenever it advances a build cycle. This way, all development branches know what
the newest build cycle is for each component. They can then consistently advance
the build cycles so there is no redundant use of any build cycle.</p>

<p>If a development system is "behind" any of the *master branch build cycles, it
should be considered "out-of-date". To bring itself "up-to-date" will involve
either an ArchivingBackups reload of the out-of-date data, or a *git "pull"
from the Basic code repository as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Basic_BLD.</strong><br>
The Basic_BLD level tracks the cycles of changes within the
Basic system. Whenever either of the Projects-Geany, Procs-Dev folders have
one or more files changed, the Basic_BLD level should be advanced. Since the
Basic_BLD level is set within the Basic/BasicVersion project, the
Accounitng project is considered advanced with the Basic_BLD level.</p>

<p>The revision number of the Basic_BLD level tracks the releases of the publisher
territories to the congregation for distribution. Whenever a new "release" of
the publisher territories is put out for distribution, the revision number of
the Basic_BLD level is the base for that release. The Basic_BLD cycle is then
reset to 0 and starts a new series of cycles as discussed previously.</p>

<p>The version number of the Basic_BLD level is used to track MAJOR changes in the
publisher territory data. The version number should only be changed in the event
of moving the critical files to a different folder system, or when there is
a change in the file structure of the Basic system.</p>

<p>The shell files IncCyc.sh, IncRev.sh, and IncVer.sh increment the cycle,
revision, and cycle elements of the Basic_BLD version.

<h3 id="4.0">4.0 Project Build.</h3>

<p>There is no "build" procedure for the BasicVersion project. Instead, shell
files perform all the BasicVersion functions. A "version" consists of three
elements: version, revision, and cycle. The version numbering begins at 1; the
revision and cycle numbers begin at 0. The version number for the Basic
system is set in the environment variable Basic_BLD.</p>

<p>The version number is the major version. This number advances whenever there is
a major, usually system-wide, change made to the application/modules that the
version control identifies. An example would be when the parent folders for the
project are anchored in a different folder on the host system.</p>

<p>The revision number is the revision level on the major version. This number
advances whenever there is a major revision to the application/modules
identified by the version control. An example would be when the schema for a
system-wide database is changed.</p>

<p>The cycle number is the cycle number on the revision level. This number advances
whenever there is any update or change in the application/modules identified by
the version control. An example would be when new data is downloaded into the
application.</p>

<p>The BasicVersion current build number is maintained in the file
"CurrVersion". The BasicVersion repository
has a *master branch that contains the CurrVersion file, and the shell
files for Basic version management. Each machine utilizing the
BasicVersion project has its own branch of the repository. In addition, each
branch of the AccngVersion repository has its own CurrVersion file. The
version within the *master CurrVersion file should exactly match the
*Basic_BLD environment variable value set in that machine's loaded accounting
configuration file.</p>

<p>If the CurrVersion file within a branch does not match the running *master
CurrVersion file, that branch is either "ahead of" or "behind" the running
version. While this may be acceptable on a development computer, the mismatch
will possibly result in inaccuracies or errors in the accounting system.</p>

<p>Folowing are the shell files in the *master branch for BasicVersion:</p>

<pre><code>
IncCyc.sh - increment cycle number in current < type > version.
IncRev.sh - increment revision number in current < type > version.
IncVer.sh - increment version number in current < type > version.
SetVersion.sh - "check in" the Current--Version files and set in target branch.
CheckSysVersion.sh - check the CurrentVersion in the active branch against
 the version in the MachVersion/CurrentVersion.
</code></pre>

<p>The CurrVersion file is initialized for
the Basic project as "1.0.0". From that time forward, each value is
changed by the IncCyc, IncRev, and IncVer shells. It should be noted that there
is no tracking to force any given version number to be recorded in any of th
child branches. Hence, version numbers may be skipped in assignment to
branches.</p>

<p>The Basic build management should be done in the following sequence:</p>

<pre><code>
    Advance the specific version (ru, sc, cb, pt) using one, or more, of the
     IncCyc, IncRev, or IncVer shells

    from the *master branch, execute the SetVersion shell on the *master branch
     first
      ./SetVersion master 
     this will update the *master branch with the latest version advancements

    from the *master branch, execute the SetVersion shell on the
     machine-specific branch

    'push' the machine-specific branch to GitHub/BasicVersion
      git push origin < machine-branch >

    'push' the *master branch to GitHub/BasicVersion
      git push origin master
</code></pre>

<p>Upon completion of the above steps, the active branch will be the last branch
on which SetVersion operated.</p>

<p><strong>Updating Within the *master Branch.</strong><br>
At times it may be necessary to udpate shells or other files within the *master
branch (e.g. SetVersion.sh, README.md). This type of update should be considered
as a code base modification. Hence, whenever an operation of this type is
performed, the CurrVersion should be updated with the IncCyc, IncRev, or
IncVer shell. This sequence of events will leave whatever file(s) have been
edited and the CurrVersion file as "changed" in the working space.</p>

<p>Since this is considered a code base modification, it is imperative to update
the *master with the latest version information. To provide a way to track this
type of update, SetVersion is run on the *master branch, but no other branches,
since this was strictly a *master branch update.<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>./SetVersion.sh master<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two additional steps should then be performed: 1) 'push the *master branch
upstream to GitHub, 2) run SetVersion to update the version information in the
appropriate &lt; machine-branch >.</p>

<pre><code>
    git push origin master
    .SetVersion.sh  < machine-branch > -f
</code></pre>

<p>This will ensure that the &lt; machine-branch > has been properly updated with the
latest CurrVersion. It also leaves *master up-to-date in the upstream
BasicVersion repository.

<h3 id="5.0">5.0 Significant Notes.</h3>

<p>When a Release is built for distribution of any of the Basic system
libraries or files, it is "branded" with the the release date and the
CurrVersion value as filename "Basic_BLD.ver.rev.cyc" so that it is
immediately evident which build level constructed the release accounting files.
This will facilitate tracking any features and/or errors to build levels.
